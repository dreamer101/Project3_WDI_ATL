* Scaffolded project with socket.io, Oath for Twitter, FB 	& Google

* Did not install angular animate or animate-css. These can be added later via bower, however ngAnimate will have to be added to the dependencies in client/app/app.js

* ran `yo angular-fullstack:endpoint vendor` (note: singular)

*changed the vendor schema, the location object syntax I got from the internet, but not sure how we'd use later this given that the street is a String. changed function to 'category' for now b/c I thought JS might treat it differently b/c it's 'function'
